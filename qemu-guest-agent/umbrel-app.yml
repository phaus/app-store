  This is supportive, if you want to run Umbrel as a Guest under QEMU.
  It allows the QEMU host to exchange information with the guest.
  This is a fork of https://github.com/dskad/qemu-ga-container to support ARM64 builds.
  Details about the guest agent itself can be found here: https://wiki.qemu.org/Features/GuestAgent 
  This app does run as a daemon in the background and does not require a port.
  The icon is [Hypervisor Icons created by Kalashnyk - Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/de/kostenlose-icons/hypervisor).  
  The image comes from [Perform Consistent Snapshots with qemu guest agent](https://feisky.xyz/posts/2015-02-10-perform-consistent-snapshots-with-qemu-guest-agent/).
