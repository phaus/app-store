  This agent should be installed, if you want to run Umbrel as a Guest under QEMU.  
  It allows the QEMU host to exchange information with the guest.  
  This is a fork of <a href="https://github.com/dskad/qemu-ga-container">https://github.com/dskad/qemu-ga-container</a> to support ARM64 builds.  
  Details about the guest agent itself can be found <a href="https://wiki.qemu.org/Features/GuestAgent">here</a>  
  This app does run as a daemon in the background and does not require a port.  
  The icon is <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/de/kostenlose-icons/hypervisor">Hypervisor Icons created by Kalashnyk - Flaticon</a>.
